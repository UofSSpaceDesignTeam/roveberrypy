# rover-software

This project includes all of the client, server, and embedded software elements written for the University of Saskatchewan Space Design Team's Mars Rover project. 
For more information on the team, see [usst.ca](http://usst.ca)

### Update 09/24

All of the 2014-2015 code has been removed and only a skelleton of the rover main software remains.
To view Legacy Code please download one of our "releases".

We will be doing a near complete rewrite for 2015-2016 of most modules. The main framework aims to be backward compatable with old rover modules.

Please see our Wiki for design information. The team will be updating it over the course of the year.
