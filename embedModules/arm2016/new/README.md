This is just a quick list of things I can think of that we still need to do on the arm board


TODO
====
- [ ] Finish duty-cycle manager but for the time being we can just set everything to +/- 255 depending on the direction
- [ ] Test communication
- [ ] Finish control file
- [ ] Fill in pinout
- [ ] Test feedback
- [ ] Write .ino file
- [ ] Calibrate arm
- [ ] Add limits
- [ ] Figure out how to determine if a motor should be shut off until the next command for inverse kin
- [ ] Inverse kinematics
- [ ] Testing, testing, testing!!

There's probably more but this is what I could think of off the top of my head.
