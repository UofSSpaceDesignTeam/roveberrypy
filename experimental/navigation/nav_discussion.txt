 	Add your own too!							

	LIAM, 8/16/2015:							

	Command Idea:								
	First major command we should have is driving to a given coordinate	
	(if we were able to even get here by the time we go to Poland that	
	would be awesome but if we dont then oh well.				

	We should have two basic commands: 					
		- rotate the rover						
		- drive a given distance					

	These two basic commands should be our main focus until we get them	
	working reliably.							

	The other big thing is that we need some rover process to be written	
	which contains a queue of nav commands. We then also need some simple	
	functions to be written to emulate joystick commands for actually	
 	driving the rover(eg it would be nice to be able to set the speed 	
	to each side of wheels.							

	Heading Idea:								
	The other major concern we have right now is that we are having 	
 	trouble determining the direction that the rover is looking in.	I think
 	that we should try to use accelerometers instead of the magnetometer.	

	Since we can caluate our heading while moving we could us this to 	
	pseudo calibrate a dynamic scaling function which could be updated 	
	everytime the rover rotates. The process would sort of go like this	

	1. Get the heading before the rover stopped.				
	2. Begin rotating							
	3. Integrate the rot. acc. detected by the accelerometers		
	4. Once our guess at our heading reaches the desired bearing then stop 	
	   stop rotating							
	5. Begin driving forward						
	6. Detemine new heading and then use this to recalibrate/update the 	
	   scaling function							


	The other idea I had for the driving was just to never actually stop
	driving. I know it sounds ridiculous and I thought it was too at first	
	but I think that it actually would be possible				

	Ideas for object avoidance:						
	We dont actually need to "detect objects" I think that we should just	
 	have it so that if we see something with the LiDar we change our 	
	heading so that our course if tangent to the objects edge. The edge we 	
	could simply see by looking at the difference in distance between Lidar	
	readings.
